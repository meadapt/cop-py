# Copipy - Python Project Template

Welcome to **[copipy](https://github.com/meadapt/copipy)**, a Python project template powered by the [Copier library](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)!
This template helps you kickstart your Python projects with best practices and pre-configured tools.

## Prerequisites

Before using this template, ensure you have the following:

1. Git 2.27+ installed.
1. Python 3.9+ installed.
1. [pipx installed](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/).
1. [Copier installed via pipx](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation)

## Getting Started

Run the `copier copy` command to create your new Python project:

```bash
$ copier copy gh:meadapt/copipy destination-folder
```

Follow the prompts provided by [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to customize your new Python project.
The `copier copy` command works similarly to `git clone`, but instead of cloning the template repository as-is, it creates a new folder (specified as `destination-folder`) and populates it with a fully personalized file structure based on your answers.
The resulting project is fully independent of the template repository.
Replace `destination-folder` with the path where you'd like to create your project, which could be just `.` to indicate the creation in your current working directory.

## Features

- Pre-configured tools for linting, testing, and formatting.
-   Git initialized and ready to use right out of the box.
- Easy-to-follow structure for Python projects.
- Customizable settings to fit your needs.
