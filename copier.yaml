        An awesome project needs an awesome name. Tell me yours.
           Here, you can use capital letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, and other characters.
           This name will be used, for example, in the title of your README.md file.
           We recommend keeping it short, simple, and meaningful.
           Short names are easier to understand, maintain, and use as your project evolves.
           If you're having difficulty coming up with a great name that meets these criteria, why not ask chatGPT for help.

        Isn't {{ project_name | slugify }} perfect for the project's directory name?
           Why we're suggestin this name?
           Convention Over configuration.
           In this case the conventions are:
             - lowercase letters to maintain consistency across operating systems.
             - Separate words with hyphens (`-`) for better readability and compatibility with command-line tools.
             - Keep it short and descriptive to make paths easier to type and understand.
             - Avoid special characters like `@`, `#`, `$`, or `&`. Stick to letters, numbers, and hyphens.
             - Choose a name that reflects your project's purpose or functionality.

           Convention Over configuration.
           In this case the conventions are:
             - lowercase letters to maintain consistency across operating systems.
             - Separate words with underscore (`_`) for consistency and compatibility with Python. In Python, hyphens are not allowed in module or package names, which can lead to import errors and execution issues.
             - Keep it short and descriptive to make paths easier to type and understand.
             - Avoid special characters like `@`, `#`, `$`, or `&`. Stick to letters, numbers, and hyphens.
             - A name that reflects your project's directory name.
